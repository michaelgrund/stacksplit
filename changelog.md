# Changelog

## Release v3.0 (in progress)

* adjusted and updated several StackSplit functions to work on newer MATLAB versions (>=2020a)
* removed or replaced deprecated built-in MATLAB functions 
* added warning message box if non-nulls and nulls are selected together for stacking (which is not really reasonable)
* added warning message box if current screen resolution does not allow to display StackSplit's main panel properly:
  * Solution for **Windows 10**: under *Settings* => *System* => *Display* => *Scale and Layout* => *Change the size of text, apps, and other items*
  the selection sometimes is set to a value different from 100% (e.g. 150%)
  which effectively reduces your screen size in pixels. Set it to 125% or
  better 100% and check again, mostly then the panel fits on the screen.
