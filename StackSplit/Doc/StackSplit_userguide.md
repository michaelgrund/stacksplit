Requirements
============

StackSplit should run on every computer system on which the original SplitLab1 package runs.
Thus, MATLAB 7.0 or higher, the Mapping toolbox and for full functionality the Signal Processing
toolbox are required. If MATLAB 2014b or higher is running on your system or no license for the
Mapping toolbox is available, I recommend to use the updated SplitLab version of Rob Porritt2.
However, StackSplit was designed to work with both versions (with and without the Mapping
toolbox) and the installer checks which of both is stored on your system.
For further information on SplitLab see the corresponding UserGuide that is included in the download
package.
