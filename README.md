### A plugin for multi-event shear wave splitting analyses in SplitLab

StackSplit is a plugin for the MATLAB toolbox SplitLab (Wüstefeld et al., 2008) which allows to apply multi-event techniques for shear wave splitting measurements (SWS) directly from within the main program (for details see the UserGuide). 

If you make use of StackSplit in your work please acknowledge my paper in which the program is described:

- Grund, M. (2017), StackSplit - a plugin for multi-event shear wave splitting analyses in SplitLab, in revision, Computers & Geosciences.


Up to now (04/2017) four stacking schemes for single SWS splitting measurments made with SplitLab are available in the download package:

- SIMW: simultaneous inversion of multiple waveforms in time domain (Roy et al., 2017)

- stacking of error surfaces, normalized on minimum/maximum (depending on input) of each single surface (Wolfe & Silver, 1998)

- modified WS method with weight depending on SNR of each measurement and normalization regarding the available backazimuth directions (Restivo & Helffrich, 1999)

- stacking of error surfaces without weighting following e.g. PhD thesis of Wüstefeld (2007)
